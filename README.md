This data set is created only for the learning purpose of the customer segmentation concepts , also known as market basket analysis . I will demonstrate this by using unsupervised ML technique (KMeans Clustering Algorithm) in the simplest form.

Malls or shopping complexes are often indulged in the race to increase their customers and hence making huge profits. To achieve this task machine learning is being applied by many stores already.
It is amazing to realize the fact that how machine learning can aid in such ambitions. The shopping complexes make use of their customersâ€™ data and develop ML models to target the right ones. This not only increases sales but also makes the complexes efficient.
